# MetadataTestingUnturned
RocketMod Plugin that allows you to see and change metadata for items in Unturned (rudimentary as it is just for testing, not recommended for use on public servers).

/ib
Opens a menu where you can place items to get a info dump about the item, including its metadata, attachments, ammo, etc.

/e <sight | tactical | grip | barrel | ammo | firerate> ID (IF AMMO, ammo count up to 255)
Allows you to change gun properties. You can make a Luger automatic with a 16x scope that shoots Shadowstalker Mk2 shots at 3000 rpm.

/gi <item id> [metadata]
Give yourself an item with a specific metadata. (metadata should look like 0,0,0,0,0,0 etc)

Luger i was talking about: /gi 1476 40,1,239,3,145,0,149,0,163,5,255,2,1,100,100,100,100,100
I made a guide on what those numbers mean on Steam Community if you're interested:
