# MetadataTestingUnturned
RocketMod Plugin that allows you to see and change metadata for items in Unturned (rudimentary as it is just for testing, not recommended for use on public servers).

/ib
Opens a menu where you can place items to get a info dump about the item, including its metadata, attachments, ammo, etc.

/e <sight | tactical | grip | barrel | ammo | firerate> ID (IF AMMO, ammo count up to 255)
Allows you to change gun properties. You can make a Luger automatic with a 16x scope that shoots Shadowstalker Mk2 shots at 3000 rpm.

/gi <item id> [metadata]
Give yourself an item with a specific metadata. (metadata should look like 0,0,0,0,0,0 etc)
